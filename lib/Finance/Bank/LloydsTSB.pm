Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB - Check your bank accounts from Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB;
  my @accounts = Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB->check_balance(
        username  => $username,
        password  => $password
        memorable => $memorable_phrase
  );
  for my $acc (@accounts) {
    printf "%20s : %8s / %19s : GBP %9.2f\n",
      $acc->name, ($acc->sort_code || ''), $acc->account_no, $acc->balance;
  }
  my $statement = $accounts[0]->fetch_statement;

  # Retrieve QIF for all transactions in January 2008.
  my $qif = $accounts[1]->download_statement(2008, 01, 01, 5);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a rudimentary interface to the LloydsTSB online
banking system at C<https://online.lloydstsb.co.uk/>. You will need
either C<Crypt::SSLeay> or C<IO::Socket::SSL> installed for HTTPS
support to work with LWP.

=head1 ACCOUNT OBJECT METHODS

=over 4

=item * $ac->name

=item * $ac->sort_code

=item * $ac->account_no


Return the name of the account, the sort code formatted as the familiar
XX-YY-ZZ, and the account number.

=item * $ac->balance

Return the balance as a signed floating point value.

=item * $ac->statement
