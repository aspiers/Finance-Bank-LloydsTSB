NAME
    Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB - Check your bank accounts from Perl

SYNOPSIS
      use Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB;
      my @accounts = Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB->check_balance(
            username  => $username,
            password  => $password
            memorable => $memorable_phrase
      );
      for my $acc (@accounts) {
        printf "%20s : %8s / %19s : GBP %9.2f\n",
          $acc->name, ($acc->sort_code || ''), $acc->account_no, $acc->balance;
      }
      my $statement = $accounts[0]->fetch_statement;

      # Retrieve QIF for all transactions in January 2008.
      my $qif = $accounts[1]->download_statement(2008, 01, 01, 5);

    See fetch-statement.pl for a working example.

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a rudimentary interface to the LloydsTSB online
    banking system at "https://online.lloydstsb.co.uk/". You will need
    either "Crypt::SSLeay" or "IO::Socket::SSL" installed for HTTPS support
    to work with LWP.

WARNING
    This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and that
    means BE CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source
    of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing
    anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful to me,
    but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.
