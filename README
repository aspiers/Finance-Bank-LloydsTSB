NAME
    Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB - Check your bank accounts from Perl

SYNOPSIS
      use Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB;
      for (Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB->check_balance(
            username=> $username,
            password=> $password)) {
          printf "%20s : %8s / %8s : GBP %9.2f\n", 
                 $_->name, $_->sort_code, $_->account_no, $_->balance;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a rudimentary interface to the LloydsTSB online
    banking system at "https://online.lloydstsb.co.uk/". You will need
    either "Crypt::SSLeay" or "IO::Socket::SSL" installed for HTTPS support
    to work with LWP. The only method it currently provides is
    "check_balance", which returns a list of account objects, each of which
    can be queried for name, sort code, account number and balance as shown
    above. Eventually it may acquire online payment capability.

WARNING
    This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and that
    means BE CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source
    of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing
    anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful to me,
    but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.
